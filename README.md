# Project 3: **Bookaroo**
## Team 6: Lisa Burr, Lena Santana, Justin Shin
Bookaroo is based on the idea submitted by Jared Edwards:
> Utilize the Google books api to help metro commuters explore new reading options. The app will be able to hold the preview text of a book randomly selected via the categories the user chooses so that during their no wifi/service metro ride they can see if they find something new.

# User Stories:

- As a user I want the app to return a preview/sample from the random book.

## Silver
- As a user I want the app to connect to an API for a book repository such as Google Books or Open Books.
