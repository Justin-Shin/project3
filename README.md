# project3

Each project should include a readme.md that provides information as to the roles of each member of the group. Specifically, it should include the responsibilities of each member and their accomplishments.

<h1>Project 3 - Bookaroo</h1>
<h2>Team 6 - Justin Shin, Lena Santana, Lisa Burr</h2>

<p>Concept: Bookaroo is based on the idea submitted by Jared Edwards: "Utilize the Google books api to help metro commuters explore new reading options. The app will be able to hold the preview text of a book randomly selected via the categories the user chooses so that during their no wifi/service metro ride they can see if they find something new".</p>

<p>User Stories:</p>

<p>MVP</p>
- As a user I want to search for a book by genre.
- As a user I want an app that returns a list of books by genre.
- As a user I want the app to display the pertinent information about the book such as: Title, author, genre, ISBN, and summary.
- As a user I want the app to return a preview/sample from a random book.
- As a user I want the app to display the cover of the book.
- As a user I want the app to download previews of books for off-line browsing
- As a user I want the app to connect to an API for a book repository such as Google Books or Open Books.
