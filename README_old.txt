# project3

Each project should include a readme.md that provides information as to the roles of each member of the group. Specifically, it should include the responsibilities of each member and their accomplishments.

<h1>Project 3 - Bookaroo</h1>
<h2>Team 6 - Justin Shin, Lena Santana, Lisa Burr</h2>

<p>Concept: Bookaroo is based on the idea submitted by Jared Edwards: "Utilize the Google books api to help metro commuters explore new reading options. The app will be able to hold the preview text of a book randomly selected via the categories the user chooses so that during their no wifi/service metro ride they can see if they find something new".</p>
