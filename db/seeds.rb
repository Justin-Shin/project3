title: "Guns, germs, and steel: the fates of human societies",
author: "Jared Diamond",
summary: "Most of this work deals with non-Europeans, but Diamond's thesis sheds light on why Western civilization became hegemonic: 'History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.' Those who domesticated plants and animals early got a head start on developing writing, government, technology, weapons of war, and immunity to deadly germs. (LJ 2/15/97)

preview: " This book attempts to provide a short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years. The question motivating the book is: Why did history unfold differently on different continents? In case this question immediately makes you shudder at the thought that you are about to read a racist treatise, you aren't: as you will see, the answers to the question don't involve human racial differences at all. The book's emphasis is on the search for ultimate explanations, and on pushing back the chain of historical causation as far as possible...",

author: "Gretchen Rubin",
summary: "A WALL STREET JOURNAL SUMMER PICK<br><br>A WASHINGTON POST BESTSELLER<br><br>Warrior and writer, genius and crank, rider in the British cavalry's last great charge and inventor of the tank, Winston Churchill led Britain to fight alone against Nazi Germany in the fateful year of 1940 and set the standard for leading a democracy at war. With penetrating insight and vivid anecdotes, Gretchen Rubin makes Churchill accessible and meaningful to twenty-first-century readers by analyzing the many contrasting views of the man: he was an alcoholic, he was not; he was an anachronism, he was a visionary; he was a racist, he was a humanitarian; he was the most quotable man in the history of the English language, he was a bore.<br><br>Like no other portrait of its famous subject, Forty Ways to Look at Winston Churchill is a dazzling display of facts more improbable than fiction. It brings to full realization the depiction of a man too fabulous for any novelist to construct, too complex for even the longest narrative to describe, and too significant ever to be forgotten.",

preview: "As their subtitles reveal, most of Churchill's biographers acclaim him as a hero: Isaiah Berlin's mystical tribute, A Portrait of a Great Man at a Great Moment; Geoffrey Best's balanced praise, A Study in Greatness; Martin Gilbert's meticulous volumes, including The Prophet of Truth and Finest Hour; William Manchester's virile adventure story, The Last Lion. Memoirs like Violet Bonham-Carter's intimate portrait, Pug Ismay's loyal account, and Jock Colville's reminiscences argue the same case. And of course, of all the mythmakers, no one did more than Churchill himself to construct the heroic Churchill.<br><br>A torrent of facts proves their conclusions: that Churchill was a great man and the savior of his country; a farsighted statesman; a brilliant politician, orator, and writer; a loving husband and father; a man with a few endearing faults—or if not endearing, excusable.<br><br>No leader did more for his country than Winston Churchill. Brave, magnanimous, traditional, he was like a king-general from Britain's heroic past. His gigantic qualities set him apart from ordinary humanity; there seemed no danger he feared, no effort too great for his limitless energies....",

author: "Howard Zinn",
summary: "Since its original landmark publication in 1980, A People's History of the United States has been chronicling American history from the bottom up, throwing out the official version of history taught in schools — with its emphasis on great men in high places — to focus on the street, the home, and the, workplace.Known for its lively, clear prose as well as its scholarly research, A People's History is the only volume to tell America's story from the point of view of — and in the words of — America's women, factory workers, African-Americans, Native Americans, the working poor, and immigrant laborers.<br><br> As historian Howard Zinn shows, many of our country's greatest battles — the fights for a fair wage, an eight-hour workday, child-labor laws, health and safety standards, universal suffrage, women's rights, racial equality — were carried out at the grassroots level, against bloody resistance. Covering Christopher Columbus's arrival through President Clinton's first term, A People's History of the United States, which was nominated for the American Book Award in 1981, features insightful analysis of the most important events in our history.<br><br>Revised, updated, and featuring a new afterword by the author, this special twentieth anniversary edition continues Zinn's important contribution to a complete and balanced understanding of American history.",

preview: "Arawak men and women, naked, tawny, and full of wonder, emerged from their villages onto the island's beaches and swam out to get a closer look at the strange big boat. When Columbus and his sailors came ashore, carrying swords, speaking oddly, the Arawaks ran to greet them, brought them food, water, gifts. He later wrote of this in his log:<br><br>They ... brought us parrots and balls of cotton and spears and many other things, which they exchanged for the glass beads and hawks' bells. They willingly traded everything they owned... . They were well-built, with good bodies and handsome features.... They do not bear arms, and do not know them, for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance. They have no iron. Their spears are made of cane... . They would make fine servants.... With fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want.<br><br>These Arawaks of the Bahama Islands were much like Indians on the mainland, who were remarkable (European observers were to say again and again) for their hospitality, their belief in sharing. These traits did not stand out in the Europe of the Renaissance, dominated as it was by the religion of popes, the government of kings, the frenzy for money that marked Western civilization and its first messenger to the Americas, Christopher Columbus.",

The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets - but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. ",

title: "A Study in Scarlet",
author: "Arthur Conan Doyle",
summary: "A Study in Scarlet is an 1887 detective novel by British author Arthur Conan Doyle. Written in 1886, the story marks the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who would become two of the most famous characters in popular fiction. The book's title derives from a speech given by Holmes, an amateur detective, to his friend and chronicler Watson on the nature of his work, in which he describes the story's murder investigation as his 'study in scarlet': 'There's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it.

Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy's country.

I was removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.<br><br>Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base hospital at Peshawar.

For months my life was despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship 'Orontes,' and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.",

title: "White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America",
author: "Nancy Isenberg",
summary: "The wretched and landless poor have existed from the time of the earliest British colonial settlement to todays hillbillies. They were alternately known as 'waste people,' 'offals,' 'rubbish,' 'lazy lubbers,' and 'crackers.' By the 1850s, the downtrodden included so-called 'clay eaters' and 'sandhillers,' known for prematurely aged children distinguished by their yellowish skin, ragged clothing, and listless minds.<br><br>Surveying political rhetoric and policy, popular literature and scientific theories over four hundred years, Isenberg upends assumptions about Americas supposedly class-free society––where liberty and hard work were meant to ensure real social mobility. Poor whites were central to the rise of the Republican Party in the early nineteenth century, and the Civil War itself was fought over class issues nearly as much as it was fought over slavery. Reconstruction pitted poor white trash against newly freed slaves, which factored in the rise of eugenics–-a widely popular movement embraced by Theodore Roosevelt that targeted poor whites for sterilization. These poor were at the heart of New Deal reforms and LBJ's Great Society; they haunt us in reality TV shows like Here Comes Honey Boo Boo and Duck Dynasty.<br><br>Marginalized as a class, white trash have always been at or near the center of major political debates over the character of the American identity.<br><br>We acknowledge racial injustice as an ugly stain on our nation's history.

preview: "Clinton's embarrassing second term didn't seem to provide lessons, insofar as the Republicans plunged ahead with their own (effectively) white trash candidate in 2008, Alaska governor Sarah Palin. The devastatingly direct Frank Rich of the New York Times referred to the Republican ticket as 'Palin and McCain's Shotgun Marriage.' Did the venerable John McCain of Arizona, ordinarily a savvy politician, have a lapse in judgment here? Slate produced an online video of Palin's hometown of Wasilla, painting it as a forgettable wasteland, a place 'to get gas and pee' before getting back on the road. Wasilla was elsewhere described as the 'punch line for most redneck jokes told in Anchorage.'<br><br>Erica Jong wrote in the Huffington Post, 'White trash America certainly has allure for voters,' which explains the photoshopped image of Palin that appeared on the Internet days after her nomination. In a stars-and-stripes bikini, holding an assault rifle and wearing her signature black-rimmed glasses, Palin was one-half hockey mom and one-half hot militia babe.<br><br>News of the pregnancy of Palin's teenage daughter Bristol led to a shotgun engagement to Levi Johnston, which was arranged in time for the Republican National Convention. Us Weekly featured Palin on the cover, with the provocative title, 'Babies, Lies, and Scandal.' Maureen Dowd compared Palin to Eliza Doolittle of My Fair Lady fame, in getting prepped for her first off-script television interview. Could there be any more direct allusion to her questionable class origins? The Palin melodrama led one journalist to associate the Alaska clan with the plot of a Lifetime television feature. The joke was proven true to life two years later, when the backwoods candidate gave up her gig as governor and starred in her own reality TV show, titled Sarah Palin's Alaska.<br><br>Palin's candidacy was a remarkable event on all accounts. She was only the second female of any kind and the first female redneck to appear on a presidential ticket. John McCain's advisers admitted that she had been selected purely for image purposes, and they joined the chorus trashing the flawed candidate after Obama's historic victory. Leaks triggered a media firestorm over Palin's wardrobe expense account. An angry aide categorized the Palins' shopping spree as 'Wasilla hillbillies looting Neiman Marcus from coast to coast.'<br><br>The Alaskan made an easy and attractive target. Journalists were flabbergasted when she showed no shame in displaying astounding lapses in knowledge. Her bungled interview with NBC host Katie Couric represented more than gotcha journalism: Palin didn't just misconstrue facts; she came across as a woman who was unable to articulate a single complex idea. (The old cracker slur as 'idle-headed' seemed to fit.) But neither did Andrew Jackson run as an 'idea man' in an earlier century, and it was his style of backcountry hubris that McCain's staffers had been hoping to revive. Shooting wolves from a small plane, bragging about her love of moose meat, 'Sarah from Alaska' positioned herself as a regular Annie Oakley on the campaign trail.<br><br>It was not enough to rescue her from the mainstream (what she self-protectively called 'lamestream') media. Sarah Palin did not have a self-made woman's résumé. She could not offset the 'white trash' label as the Rhodes Scholar Bill Clinton could. She had attended six unremarkable colleges. She had no military experience (à la navy veteran Jimmy Carter), though she did send one son off to Iraq. Writing in the New Yorker, Sam Tanenhaus was struck by Palin's self-satisfied manner: 'the certitude of being herself, in whatever unfinished condition, will always be good enough.'<br><br>Maureen Dowd quipped that Palin was a 'country-music queen without the music.' She lacked the self-deprecating humor of Dolly Parton—not to mention the natural talent. The real conundrum was why, even more than how, she was chosen: the white trash Barbie was at once visually appealing and disruptive, and she came from a state whose motto on license plates read, 'The Last Frontier.' The job was to package the roguish side of Palin alongside a comfortable, conventional female script. In the hit country single 'Redneck Woman' (2004), Gretchen Wilson rejected Barbie as an unreal middle-class symbol—candidate Palin's wardrobe bingeing was her Barbie moment.<br><br>Her Eliza Doolittle grand entrance came during the televised debate with Senator Joe Biden of Delaware. As the nation waited to see what she looked like and how she performed, Palin came onstage in a little black dress, wearing heels and pearls, and winked at the camera. From the neck down she looked like a Washington socialite, but the wink faintly suggested a gum-chewing waitress at a small-town diner. Embodying these two extremes, the fetching hockey mom image ultimately lost out to what McCain staffers identified as both 'hillbilly' and 'prima donna.'<br><br>Sex formed a meaningful subtext throughout Palin's time of national exposure. In terms of trash talk, daughter Bristol Palin's out‑of‑wedlock pregnancy was handled rather differently from Bill Clinton's legendary philandering. Bloggers muddied the waters by spreading rumors about Sarah's Down syndrome child, Trig: 'Was he really Bristol's?' they asked. A tale of baby swapping was meant to suggest a new twist on the backwoods immorality of inbred illegitimacy. Recall that it was Bill Clinton's mother, Virginia, whose pedigree most troubled the critics. The legacy held: the rhetoric supporting eugenics (and the sterilization laws that followed) mainly targeted women as tainted breeders.<br><br>Sarah Palins Fargo-esque accent made her tortured speech patterns sound even worse. Former TV talk show host Dick Cavett wrote a scathing satirical piece in which he dubbed her a 'serial syntax killer' whose high school English department deserved to be draped in black. He wanted to know how her swooning fans, who adored her for being a 'mom like me,' or were impressed to see her shooting wolves, could explain how any of those traits would help her to govern.<br><br>We had been down this road before as citizens and voters. 'Honest Abe' Lincoln was called an ape, a mudsill, and Kentucky white trash. Andrew Jackson was a rude, ill-tempered cracker. (And like Palin, his grammar was nothing to brag about.) The question loomed: At what point does commonness cease to be an asset, as a viable form of populism, and become a liability for a political actor? And should anyone be shocked when voters are swept up in an 'almost Elvis-sized following,' as Cavett said Palin's were? When you turn an election into a three-ring circus, there's always a chance that the dancing bear will win.",

title: "Hitler: Ascent, 1889-1939",
author: "Volker Ullrich",
summary: "For all the literature about Adolf Hitler there have been just four seminal biographies; this is the fifth, a landmark work that sheds important new light on Hitler himself. Drawing on previously unseen papers and a wealth of recent scholarly research, Volker Ullrich reveals the man behind the public persona, from Hitler's childhood to his failures as a young man in Vienna to his experiences during the First World War to his rise as a far-right party leader. Ullrich deftly captures Hitler's intelligence, instinctive grasp of politics, and gift for oratory as well as his megalomania, deep insecurity, and repulsive worldview.<br><br>Many previous biographies have focused on the larger social conditions that explain the rise of the Third Reich. Ullrich gives us a comprehensive portrait of a postwar Germany humiliated by defeat, wracked by political crisis, and starved by an economic depression, but his real gift is to show vividly how Hitler used his ruthlessness and political talent to shape the Nazi party and lead it to power. For decades the world has tried to grasp how Hitler was possible. By focusing on the man at the center of it all, on how he experienced his world, formed his political beliefs, and wielded power, this riveting biography brings us closer than ever to the answer.

preview: "HITLER by Volker Ullrich 'Hitler As Human Being' Excerpt (pgs. 382-386) As a rule, people who got a close look at the Führer for the first time were rarely impressed. After a meeting with Hitler in December 1931, the industrialist Günther Quandt deemed him the very definition of average. Sefton Delmer described him as an everyday person remi­niscent of a travelling salesman or a junior officer. As we saw, the American reporter Dorothy Thompson called Hitler the exact proto­type of the little man on the street. William Shirer, the correspondent for America's Universal News Service, also came away disappointed after seeing Hitler in September 1934 at the Nuremberg rally. 'His face,' Shirer wrote in his diary, 'had no particular expression at all—I expected it to be stronger—and for the life of me I could not quite comprehend what hidden springs he undoubtedly unloosened in the hysterical mob which was greeting him so wildly.' Hitler's appearance was hardly winning. Finance Minister von Krosigk, who met Hitler for the first time when the new chancellor was sworn in on 30 January 1933, recalled the Führer's face as being unremarkable. 'There was nothing harmonious about his features, nor did they have the irregularity that expresses individual human spirit,' Krosigk wrote. 'A lock of hair that flopped down over his forehead and the rudiments of a moustache only two fingers wide gave his appearance something comic.'<br><br>Hitler's moustache was the feature that everyone noticed. Early on, Hanfstaengl had urged him to shave it off, arguing that it was fodder for caricaturists. 'My moustache will be all the rage one day—you can bet on that,' Hitler replied. Around 1925 or 1926 he told Adelheid Klein, a friend in Munich: 'Imagine my face without the moustache! . . . My nose is much too big. I have to soften it with the moustache!'<br><br>Indeed, Hitler's large, fleshy nose was rather disproportionate to the rest of his face. Klaus Mann called it the 'most foul and most charac­teristic' aspect of Hitler's physiognomy.<br><br>For his part Albert Speer claimed that he only noticed how ugly and disproportionate Hitler's face was in the final months of the Third Reich, when the Führer's appeal was declining. 'How did I not notice that in all the years?' he wondered in his Spandau prison cell in late November 1946. 'Curious!' Almost everyone who came into contact with Hitler was struck by another feature. Upon seeing the young Hitler for the first time in 1919, Karl Alexander von Müller immediately noted his 'large, light-blue, fanatically and coldly gleaming eyes.'<br><br>Lieselotte Schmidt, an assistant and nanny to Winifred Wagner, had a different impression. Like her mistress, she admired Hitler and found that his eyes shone with goodness and warmth. 'One glance from his lovely violet-blue eyes was enough to sense his gentle temperament and good heart,' Schmidt said in 1929. Otto Wagener, the economic adviser who entered Hitler's service that same year and still professed his admiration of the Führer in a British POW camp in 1946, recalled: From the first moment, his eyes captivated me. They were clear and large and calm. He stared at me full of self-confidence. But his gaze did not come from his eyeballs. On the contrary, I felt it came from somewhere far deeper, from infinity. You could read nothing in his eyes. But they spoke and wanted to say something. From the first moment, his eyes captivated me. They were clear and large and calm. He stared at me full of self-confidence. But his gaze did not come from his eyeballs. On the contrary, I felt it came from somewhere far deeper, from infinity. You could read nothing in his eyes. But they spoke and wanted to say something. Christa Schroeder, one of Hitler's secretaries from 1933 onwards, was somewhat more sober: 'I found Hitler's eyes very expressive. They looked interested and probing and always became more animated whenever he spoke.'<br><br>The playwright Gerhart Hauptmann also noted Hitler's 'strange and lovely eyes' after meeting the Führer at the inauguration of the Reich Culture Chamber in November 1933. Whether people perceived Hitler's gaze as cold or benevolent, impenetrable or friendly and inquisitive depended both on the given situation and their political views. 'What admirers praise as the power of his eyes strikes neutral observers as a greedy stare without that hint of decency that makes a gaze truly compelling,' wrote the Hitler detractor Konrad Heiden. 'His gaze repels more than it captivates.' But even critical observers sometimes praised his eyes. 'Hitler's eyes were startling and unforgettable,' wrote Martha Dodd, the daughter of the U.S. ambassador to Germany, William Edward Dodd, after being introduced to Hitler by Hanfstaengl in 1933. 'They seemed pale blue in colour, were intense, unwavering, hypnotic.' Alongside his eyes, Hitler's hands attracted the most attention. 'So expressive in their movements as to compete with the eyes' was how Houston Stewart Chamberlain put it in a fawning letter to Hitler in 1923. For Krosigk, Hitler's hands were nervous, delicate and 'almost feminine.'<br><br>In 1933, when the philosopher Karl Jaspers voiced doubts as to whether someone as uneducated as Hitler could lead Germany, his colleague Martin Heidegger replied: 'Education is irrelevant . . . just look at those lovely hands.' Many of Heidegger's contemporaries shared his admiration for the Führer's hands. In an article for the December 1936 edition of New Literature, the head of German radio characterised Hitler's delicate hands as being the tools of an 'artist and great creator.' And in October 1942, while imprisoned in a British POW camp, General Ludwig Crüwell opined: 'His hands are truly striking—lovely hands . . . He's got the hands of an artist. My eyes were always drawn to his hands.' But more impressive than his eyes and hands was Hitler's talent for speaking. His appearance may have made him seem average and everyday, but as soon as he took to the stage, he was transformed into a demagogue the likes of which Germany had never known. Admirers and detractors were in absolute agreement on this point. In his essay 'Brother Hitler,' Thomas Mann attributed Hitler's rise to his 'eloquence, which although unspeakably base, has huge sway over the masses.'<br><br>Heiden wrote of 'an incomparable barometer of mass moods,' while Otto Strasser spoke of an 'unusually sensitive seismograph of the soul.' Strasser also compared Hitler to a 'membrane' broadcasting the most secret longings and emotions of the masses.<br><br>Krosigk concurred. 'He sensed what the masses were longing for and translated it into firebrand slogans,' the Reich finance minister wrote. 'He appealed to the instincts slumbering in people's unconsciousness and offered something to everyone.'<br><br>The American journalist Hubert R. Knickerbocker, who had encountered Hitler as a seemingly polite, small-time politician in the NSDAP's Munich headquarters in 1931, was astonished by a public appearance that same evening. 'He was an evangelist speaking at a tent meeting, the Billy Sunday of German politics,' the Pulitzer Prize winner wrote. 'Those he had converted followed him, laughed with him, felt with him. Together they mocked the French. Together they hissed off the Republic. Eight thousand people became one instrument on which Hitler played his symphony of national passion.' As Knickerbocker realised, the secret to Hitler's success lay in the mutual identification between speaker and audience—in the exchange of indi­vidual and collective sensitivities and neuroses. It was not only the faithful whom Hitler managed to put under his spell. 'There won't be anyone like him for quite some time,' Rudolf Hess wrote in 1924 while imprisoned in Landsberg, 'a man who can sweep away both the most left-wing lathe operator and the right-wing government official in a single mass event.'<br><br>Hess's view was no exag­geration. Numerous contemporaries who rejected Hitler and his party struggled to resist the lure of Hitler's overwhelming rhetoric—indeed, some succumbed to it. In his memoirs, the historian Golo Mann described the impression a Hitler speech made on him as a 19-year-old student in the autumn of 1928. 'I had to steel myself against the energy and persuasive force of the speaker,' Mann wrote. 'A Jewish friend of mine, whom I had brought along, was unable to resist. ‘He's right,' he whispered in my ear. How many times had I heard this phrase ‘He's right' uttered by listeners from whom I would have least expected it?' Hitler's talent for persuasive oration gave him a hypnotic sway over crowds. Part of his secret was his unusually powerful and variable voice. 'Those who only know Hitler from the events of later years, after he had mutated into an immoderately thundering dictator and demagogue at the microphone, have no idea what a flexible and mellif­luous instrument his natural, non-amplified voice was in the early years of his political career,' noted Hanfstaengl. It was Hitler's voice, at a speech in Weimar in March 1925, that won over Baldur von Schirach, later the Nazis' Reich youth leader, at the age of 18. 'It was a voice unlike any other I had heard from a public speaker,' Schirach recalled. 'It was deep and rough, resonant as a cello. His accent, which we thought was Austrian but was actually Lower Bavarian, was alien to central Germany and compelled you to listen.'<br><br>he called himself the greatest actor in Europe,' Krosigk recalled. That statement was one of the excessive flights of fancy to which the dictator became increasingly prone in his later years. Nonetheless, Hitler had an undeniable ability to don different masks to suit various occasions and to inhabit changing roles. 'He could be a charming conversation partner who kissed women's hands, a friendly uncle who gave children chocolate, or a man of the people who could shake the callused hands of farmers and artisans,' remarked Albert Krebs, the Gauleiter of Hamburg. When invited to the Bechstein and Bruckmann salons or to afternoon tea at the Schirachs' in Weimar, he would play the upstanding, suit-and-tie-wearing bourgeois to fit in with such social settings. At NSDAP party conferences, he dressed in a brown shirt and cast himself as a prototypical street fighter who made no secret of his contempt for polite society. Hitler adapted his speeches to people's expectations. In front of the Reichstag, he talked like a wise statesman. When he spoke to a circle of industrialists he was a man of moderation.<br><br>To women he was the good-humoured father who loved children, while in front of large crowds he was a fiery volcano. To his fellow party members he was the truest and bravest soldier who sacrificed himself and was therefore allowed to demand sacrifices of others. André François-Poncet, who witnessed Hitler's various appearances at the Nuremberg rally in 1935, was impressed by the Führer's ability to intuit the mood of each given audience. 'He found the words and tone he needed for all of them,' the French ambassador remarked. 'He ran the gamut from biting to melodramatic to intimate and lordly.' The man who succeeded François-Poncet in 1938, Robert Coulondre, was also surprised by the man he met at the Berghof retreat when he presented his letter of credence in November. 'I was expecting a thundering Jove in his castle and what I got was a simple, gentle, possibly shy man in his country home,' Coulondre reported. 'I had heard the rough, screaming, threatening and demanding voice of the Führer on the radio. Now I became acquainted with a Hitler who had a warm, calm, friendly and understanding voice. Which one is the true Hitler? Or are they both true?' Excerpted from Hitler by Volker Ullrich. Copyright © 2016 by Volker Ullrich. All rights reserved.

They had failed to agree on sports talk, public radio, golden oldies, adult comedy, and the BBC, without getting near bluegrass, CNN, opera, or a hundred other stations. Out of frustration on her part and fatigue on his, they both threw in the towel early and settled on soft jazz. Soft, so Hugo's deep and lengthy nap would not be disturbed.<br><br>Soft, because Lacy didn't care much for jazz either. It was another give-and-take of sorts, one of many that had sustained their teamwork over the years. He slept and she drove and both were content.

With budget cuts, though, those disappeared. Lacy, Hugo, and countless other public employees in Florida were now expected to use their own vehicles for the state's work, reimbursed at fifty cents a mile. Hugo, with four kids and a hefty mortgage, drove an ancient Bronco that could barely make it to the office, let alone a road trip. And so he slept. Lacy enjoyed the quiet. She handled most of her cases alone, as did her colleagues. Deeper cuts had decimated the office, and the BJC was down to its last six investigators.<br><br>Seven, in a state of twenty million people, with a thousand judges sitting in six hundred courtrooms and processing a half a million cases a year. Lacy was forever grateful that almost all judges were honest, hardworking people committed to justice and equality. Otherwise, she would have left long ago. The small number of bad apples kept her busy fifty hours a week. She gently touched the signal switch and slowed on the exit ramp. When the car rolled to a stop, Hugo lurched forward as if wide awake and ready for the day. 'Where are we?' he asked. 'Almost there. Twenty minutes. Time for you to roll to your right and snore at the window.' 'Sorry. Was I snoring?' 'You always snore, at least according to your wife.' 'Well, in my defense, I was walking the floor at three this morning with her latest child. I think it's a girl. What's her name?' 'Wife or daughter?' 'Ha‑ha.'<br><br>The lovely and ever-pregnant Verna kept few secrets when it came to her husband. It was her calling to keep his ego in check and it was no small task. In another life, Hugo had been a football star in high school, then the top-rated signee in his class at Florida State, and the first freshman to crack the starting lineup. He'd been a tailback, both bruising and dazzling, for three and a half games anyway, until they carried him off on a stretcher with a jammed vertebra in his upper spine.<br><br>He vowed to make a comeback. His mother said no. He graduated with honors and went to law school. His glory days were fading fast, but he would always carry some of the swagger possessed by all-Americans. He couldn't help it. 'Twenty minutes, huh?' he grunted. 'Sure, or not. If you like, I'll just leave you in the car with the motor running and you can sleep all day.' He rolled to his right, closed his eyes, and said, 'I want a new partner.' 'That's an idea, but the problem is nobody else will have you.' 'And one with a bigger car.' 'It gets fifty miles a gallon.' He grunted again, grew still, then twitched, jerked, mumbled, and sat straight up. He rubbed his eyes and said, 'What are we listening to?' 'We had this conversation a long time ago, when we left Tallahassee, just as you were beginning to hibernate.' 'I offered to drive, as I recall.' 'Yes, with one eye open. It meant so much. How's Pippin?' 'She cries a lot. Usually, and I say this from vast experience, when a newborn cries it's for a reason. Food, water, diaper, momma--whatever. Not this one. She squawks for the hell of it. You don't know what you're missing.' 'If you'll recall, I've actually walked the floors with Pippin on two occasions.' 'Yes, and God bless you. Can you come over tonight?' 'Anytime. She's number four. You guys thought about birth control?' 'We are beginning to have that conversation. And now that we're on the subject, how's your sex life?' 'Sorry. My mistake.' At thirty-six Lacy was single and attractive, and her sex life was a rich source of whispered curiosity around the office. They were going east toward the Atlantic Ocean. St. Augustine was eight miles ahead. Lacy finally turned off the radio when Hugo asked, 'And you've been here before?' 'Yes, a few years back. Then boyfriend and I spent a week on the beach in a friend's condo.' 'A lot of sex?' 'Here we go again. Is your mind always in the gutter?' 'Well, come to think of it, the answer has to be yes.<br><br>Plus, you need to understand that Pippin is now a month old, which means that Verna and I have not had normal relations in at least three months. I still maintain, at least to myself, that she cut me off three weeks too early, but it's sort of a moot point. Can't really go back and catch up, you know? So things are fairly ramped up in my corner; not sure she feels the same way. Three rug rats and a newborn do serious damage to that intimacy thing.' 'I'll never know.' He tried to focus on the highway for a mile or two, then his eyelids grew heavy and he began to nod. She glanced at him and smiled. In her nine years with the Board, she and Hugo had worked a dozen cases together. They made a nice team and trusted each other, and both knew that any bad behavior by him, and there had been none to date, would immediately be reported to Verna. Lacy worked with Hugo, but she gossiped and shopped with Verna. St. Augustine was billed as the oldest city in America, the very spot where Ponce de León landed and began exploring. Long on history and heavy on tourism, it was a lovely town with historic buildings and thick Spanish moss dripping from ancient oaks.<br><br>As they entered its outskirts, the traffic slowed and tour buses stopped. To the right and in the distance, an old cathedral towered above the town. Lacy remembered it all very well. The week with the old boyfriend had been a disaster, but she had fond memories of St. Augustine. One of many disasters. 'And who is this mysterious deep throat we are supposed to meet?' Hugo asked, rubbing his eyes once again, now determined to stay awake. 'Don't know yet, but his code name is Randy.' 'Okay, and please remind me why we are tag teaming a secret meeting with a man using an alias who has yet to file a formal complaint against one of our esteemed judges.' 'I can't explain. But I've talked to him three times on the phone and he sounds, uh, rather earnest.' 'Great. When was the last time you talked to a complaining party who didn't sound, uh, rather earnest?' 'Stick with me, okay? Michael said go, and we're here.' Michael was the director, their boss.<br><br>'Of course. No clue as to the alleged unethical conduct?' 'Oh yes. Randy said it was big.' 'Gee, never heard that before.' They turned onto King Street and poked along with the downtown traffic. It was mid-July, still the high season in north Florida, and tourists in shorts and sandals drifted along the sidewalks, apparently going nowhere. Lacy parked on a side street and they joined the tourists. They found a coffee shop and killed half an hour flipping through glossy real estate brochures. At noon, as instructed, they walked into Luca's Grill and got a table for three. They ordered iced tea and waited. Thirty minutes passed with no sign of Randy, so they ordered sandwiches. Fries on the side for Hugo, fruit for Lacy. Eating as slowly as possible, they kept an eye on the door and waited. As lawyers, they valued their time. As investigators, they had learned patience. The two roles were often in conflict. At 2:00 p.m., they gave up and returned to the car, as smothering as a sauna. As Lacy turned the key, her cell phone rattled. Caller unknown. She grabbed it and said, 'Yes.' A male voice said, 'I asked you to come alone.' It was Randy. 'I suppose you have the right to ask. We were supposed to meet at noon, for lunch.' A pause, then, 'I'm at the Municipal Marina, at the end of King Street, three blocks away. Tell your buddy to get lost and we'll talk.' 'Look, Randy, I'm not a cop and I don't do cloak-and-dagger very well. I'll meet you, say hello and all that, but if I don't have your real name within sixty seconds then I'm leaving.' 'Fair enough.' She canceled the call and mumbled, 'Fair enough.' The marina was busy with pleasure craft and a few fishing boats coming and going. A long pontoon was unloading a gaggle of noisy tourists. A restaurant with a patio at the water's edge was still doing a brisk business.<br><br>Crews on charter boats were spraying decks and sprucing things up for tomorrow's charters. Lacy walked along the central pier, looking for the face of a man she'd never met. Ahead, standing next to a fuel pump, an aging beach bum gave a slight, awkward wave and nodded. She returned the nod and kept walking. He was about sixty, with too much gray hair flowing from under a Panama hat. Shorts, sandals, a gaudy floral-print shirt, the typical bronze, leathery skin of someone who spent far too much time in the sun. His eyes were covered by aviator shades. With a smile he stepped forward and said, 'You must be Lacy Stoltz.' She took his hand and said, 'Yes, and you are?' 'Name's Ramsey Mix. A pleasure to meet you.' 'A pleasure. We were supposed to meet at noon.' 'My apologies. Had a bit of boat trouble.' He nodded down the pier to a large powerboat moored at the end of the dock. It wasn't the longest boat in the harbor at that moment, but it was close. 'Can we talk there?' he asked. 'On the boat?' 'Sure. It's much more private.' Crawling onto a boat with a complete stranger struck her as a bad idea and she hesitated.<br><br>Before she could answer, Mix asked, 'Who's the black guy?' He was looking in the direction of King Street. Lacy turned and saw Hugo casually following a pack of tourists nearing the marina. 'He's my colleague,' she said. 'Sort of a bodyguard?' 'I don't need a bodyguard, Mr. Mix. We're not armed, but my friend there could pitch you into the water in about two seconds.' 'Let's hope that won't be necessary. I come in peace.' 'That's good to hear. I'll get on the boat only if it stays where it is. If the engines start, then our meeting is over.' 'Fair enough.' She followed him along the pier, past a row of sailboats that looked as though they had not seen the open sea in months, and to his boat, cleverly named Conspirator.<br><br>He stepped on board and offered a hand to help her. On the deck, under a canvas awning, there was a small wooden table with four folding chairs. He waved at it and said, 'Welcome aboard. Have a seat.' Lacy took quick stock of her surroundings. Without sitting, she said, 'Are we alone?' 'Well, not entirely. I have a friend who enjoys boating with me. Name is Carlita. Would you like to meet her?' 'Only if she's important to your story.' 'She is not.' Mix was looking at the marina, where Hugo was leaning on a rail. Hugo waved, as if to say, 'I'm watching everything.' Mix waved back and said, 'Can I ask you something?' 'Sure,' Lacy said. 'Is it safe to assume that whatever I'm about to tell you will be rehashed with Mr. Hatch in short order?' 'He's my colleague. We work together on some cases, maybe this one. How do you know his name?' 'I happen to own a computer. Checked out the website. BJC really should update it.' 'I know. Budget cuts.' 'His name vaguely rings a bell.' 'He had a brief career as a football player at Florida State.' 'Maybe that's it. I'm a Gator fan myself.' Lacy refused to respond to this. It was so typical of the South, where folks attached themselves to college football teams with a fanaticism she'd always found irksome.<br><br>Mix said, 'So he'll know everything?' 'Yes.' 'Call him over. I'll get us something to drink.' 2 Carlita served drinks from a wooden tray--diet sodas for Lacy and Hugo, a bottle of beer for Mix. She was a pretty Hispanic lady, at least twenty years his junior, and she seemed pleased to have guests, especially another woman. Lacy made a note on her legal pad and said, 'A quick question. The phone you used fifteen minutes ago had a different number than the phone you used last week.' 'Is that a question?' Mix replied. 'It's close enough.' 'Okay. I use a lot of prepaid phones. And I move around all the time. I'm assuming the number I have for you is a cell phone issued by your employer, correct?' 'That's right. We don't use personal phones for state business, so my number is not likely to change.' 'That'll make it simpler, I guess. My phones change by the month, sometimes by the week.'<br><br>So far, in their first five minutes together, everything Mix said had only opened the door for more questions. Lacy was still miffed at being stood up for lunch, and she didn't like the first impression he made. She said, 'Okay, Mr. Mix, at this point Hugo and I go silent. You start talking. Tell us your story, and if it has huge gaps that require us to fish around and stumble in the dark, then we'll get bored and go home. You were coy enough on the phone to lure me here. Start talking.'<br><br>Mix looked at Hugo with a smile and asked, 'She always this blunt?' Hugo, unsmiling, nodded yes. He folded his hands on the table and waited. Lacy put down her pen. Mix swallowed a mouthful of beer and began: 'I practiced law for thirty years in Pensacola.<br><br>Small firm--we usually had five or six lawyers. Back in the day we did well and life was good. One of my early clients was a developer, a real high roller who built condos, subdivisions, hotels, strip malls, the typical Florida stuff that goes up overnight. I never trusted the guy but he was making so much money I finally took the bait. He got me in some deals, small slices here and there, and for a while it all worked. I started dreaming of getting rich, which, in Florida anyway, can lead to serious trouble. My friend was cooking the books and taking on way too much debt, stuff I didn't know about. Turns out there were some bogus loans, bogus everything, really, and the FBI came in with one of its patented RICO cluster bombs and indicted half of Pensacola, me included. A lot of folks got burned--developers, bankers, realtors, lawyers, and other shysters. You probably didn't hear about it because you investigate judges, not lawyers. Anyway, I flipped, sang like a choirboy, got a deal, pled to one count of mail fraud, and spent sixteen months in a federal camp. Lost my license and made a lot of enemies. Now I lie low. I applied for reinstatement and got my license back. I have one client these days, and he's the guy we'll talk about from now on. Questions?' <br><br>From the empty chair, he retrieved an unmarked file and handed it to Lacy. 'Here's the scoop on me. Newspaper articles, my plea agreement, all the stuff you might need. I'm legit, or as legit an any ex-con can be, and every word I'm saying is true.' Excerpted from The Whistler by John Grisham. Copyright © 2016 by John Grisham. All rights reserved.

summary: "In all of Alex Cross's years with Homicide, Washington, DC, has never been more dangerous. After shots pierce the tranquil nighttime calm of Rock Creek Park, a man is dead: what looks at first like road rage might be something much more sinister. But Alex has only just begun asking questions when he's called across town to investigate a new murder, one that hits close to home: Washington's own chief of detectives. And Alex's former boss, beloved mentor of Alex's wife, Bree. Now there's a killer on the loose, a long list of possible suspects, a city in panic, and nobody in charge of the besieged police force.
Until Bree gets tapped for the job.<br><br>As Bree scrambles to find her footing and close two high-profile cases, new violence stuns the capital. What should be a time for her to rely on Alex for support and cooperation is instead a moment of crisis in their marriage as well as their city when their investigative instincts clash and their relationship reaches a breaking point. And the fiendish mind behind all the violence has appointed himself judge, jury, and executioner, with a terrifying master plan he's only begun to put in motion. To beat him at his own game, Alex and Bree must take the law back into their own hands before he puts them both out of commission...permanently.",

preview: "One HE CHANGED IDENTITY LIKE MANY warriors do before battle. He called himself Mercury on nights like these. Dressed in black from his visor helmet to his steel-toe boots, Mercury had his motorcycle backed up into a huge rhododendron bush by the Rock Creek Parkway south of Calvert Street. He sat astride the idling bike and cradled a U.S. Army surplus light detection and ranging device. He trained the lidar on every vehicle that went past him, checking its speed.<br><br>Forty-five miles an hour, on the money. Forty-four. Fiftytwo. Routine stuff. Safe numbers. Boring numbers. Mercury was hoping to see a more exotic and inflated figure on the screen. He had good reason to believe a bloated number like that would appear before this night was over. He was certainly in the right place for it. Built in the 1920s, Rock Creek Parkway had been designed to preserve the natural scenic beauty of the area.<br><br>The winding four-lane road ran from the Lincoln Memorial north through parks, gardens, and woods. It was 2.9 miles long and split in Northwest DC. Beach Drive, the right fork, headed northeast, deeper into the park. The parkway itself continued on to the left and curled back northwest to the intersection with Calvert Street. Forty-three miles an hour, according to the lidar display. Forty-seven. Forty-five. These numbers were not surprising.<br><br>The parkway was on the National Register of Historic Places and was maintained by the National Park Service; it had a set speed limit of fortyfive miles an hour. But the parkway's meandering route was about as close to a Grand Prix circuit as you could find in or around the District of Columbia.<br><br>Elongated S curves, chicanes, a few altitude changes, straightaways that ran down the creek bottom— they were all there, and the road was almost twice the length of the fabled Grand Prix course at Watkins Glen, New York. That alone makes it a target, Mercury thought. That alone says someone will try. If not tonight, then tomorrow, or the night after. He'd read an article in the Washington Post that said that on any given night, the odds were better than one in three that some rich kid or an older prick sucking big-time off the federal teat would bring out the new Porsche or the overhorsed BMW and take a crack at Rock Creek. So might the suburban kid who'd snuck out the old man's Audi, or even a middle-aged mom or two. All sorts of people seemed obsessed by it. One try every three nights, Mercury thought. But tonight, the odds were even better than average. A few days ago, a budget crisis had closed the U.S. government. All funding for park law enforcement had been frozen. No salaries were being paid.<br><br>Park rangers had been sent home for liability reasons. There was no one looking but him. Hours went by. Traffic slowed to a trickle, and still Mercury aimed the lidar gun and shot, read the verdict, and waited. He was nodding off at a quarter to three that morning and thinking that he should pack it in when he heard the growl of a big-bore engine turning onto the parkway from Beach Drive. On that sound alone, Mercury's right hand shot out and fired up the bike. His left hand aimed the lidar at the growl, which became a whining, buzzing wail of fury coming right at him.'<br><br>The instant he had headlights, he hit the trigger. Seventy-two miles an hour. He tossed the lidar into the rhododendrons. He'd return for it later. The Maserati blew by him. Mercury twisted the accelerator and popped the clutch. He blasted out of the rhododendrons, flew off the embankment, and landed with a smoking squeal in the parkway not a hundred yards behind the Italian sports car.",
